# PageBloomFilter

Bloom filter with page, designed for storage density and query speed.

## Benchmark
![](images/Xeon-8374C.png)
We got average latency per operation under 25ns in a benchmark with 500k elements on a Xeon-8374C machine. SIMD brings significant speed-up.

It runs slower on EPYC-7K83 machine.

## Go Version

An implement based on function injection techique is avaliable for AMD64. It uses code compiled by clang in Go without CGO. A benchmark with 500k elements on a Xeon-8374C machine shows new implement runs much fast than the pure go implement.

```

We suggest that user should execute [go-inject.sh](pbf/go-inject.sh) to gnerate new injecting code before build. Clang, binutils and python are needed.
